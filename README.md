# Sai's First End to End Machine Learning Project

A complete machine learning workflow, including:

- **Data preprocessing** and feature engineering
- **Model training**: Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, and K-Means Clustering
- **Feature selection** and hyperparameter tuning
- **Model evaluation** and results visualization

This project also explores unsupervised learning techniques such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and Silhouette Analysis.
